# Amazon_Product_Review_ETL
## Overview:
The purpose of this project was to perform an ETL on an Amazon review dataset using Pyspark and Pgadmin. The dataset contained data related to video games and information that comes with products on Amazon such as the star rating and if it was a verfied purchase. After the ETL, another notebook was made with the intention of finding bias from the Amazon vine program, which pays people to leave reviews. This was done by finding out how many reviews were paid and unpaid, how many of the vine reviews were five stars, and there percentage.
## Results:
